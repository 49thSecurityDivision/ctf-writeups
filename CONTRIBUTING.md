#### Writing writeups

Things to remember when writing write ups
* submit a pull request for new ctf writeups checkout [this](https://github.com/49thSecurityDivision/personal-projects/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
* make a folder for the ctf in the following format: `$ctfName-$yearCtfHappened` (i.e. [mitrectf-2018](./mitrectf-2018))
* include the category as a folder under the ctf folder
* include the number of points as a folder under the category folder
* then do your writeup in a README.md or README.adoc (markdown or asciidoc) format so it can be rendered on github
* screen/[terminal](https://asciinema.org/) recordings are also welcome as well :grin:

example below

```
└── mitrectf-2018
    └── linux
        └── 150
            └── README.adoc
```
